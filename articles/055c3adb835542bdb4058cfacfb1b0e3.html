    1: The Visionary Architects of Ratopolis
    The blueprint of our civilization was etched by the likes of Barnabas Tailor, an architect whose innate comprehension of rat ergonomics transformed into the harmonious warrens we thrive in. “Barnabas envisaged a city that ebbed and flowed with the rhythm of ratkind. His legacy lives on in every burrow,” reflects city planner Maze Reynard. Architectural marvels like the Cheesegrater Building bear witness to such grand designs, melding practicality with splendor.
