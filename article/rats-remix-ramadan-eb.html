            <div class="comment-body">This article is just another piece of fluff that ignores the real issues! Music doesn't solve the struggles we face as a community. It's like putting a bow on a garbage pile! It's great that some rats enjoy it, but let's discuss the economic inequality that these 'soulful melodies' gloss over!</div>

            <div class="comment-body">How can you say that modern influences are overshadowing traditions? You're just scared of change! The world isn’t static, and neither should our music be. But can we stop pretending every ratfolk tune is a masterpiece? Some of it is just noise, and not the good kind.</div>

            <div class="comment-body">While I agree with some critiques, this piece highlights an important point about unity! Isn't a mix of old and new what culture is all about? Just look at the human world and their constant reinvention. We should embrace both the nostalgic folk tunes and the edgy beats instead of stuffing them into separate corners!</div>

            <div class="comment-body">Respect for traditions has got to mean something. Pushing aside our roots for modern noise isn’t progress! Where’s the appreciation for the great rat composers of yore? This article is a perfect example of how we've lost our way, drowning in 'variety' while ignoring true artistry!</div>

            <div class="comment-body">This isn't a battle between tradition and modernity; it's a collaboration. We must learn to listen and adapt—just as music evolves in nature. Nobody is trying to erase history; perhaps we can find harmony in the juxtaposition! But let's also challenge what we consider 'progressive' music, because not all change is good.</div>

            <div class="comment-body">I think the point is missed here! It's not just about music; it's about how we as rats bond during Ramadan. The melodies are an expression of identity. If some enjoy a fusion of styles, it doesn't diminish the old ones! Can't we celebrate our differences instead of arguing like cheeseheads over what's 'better'? Let's dance instead!</div>
