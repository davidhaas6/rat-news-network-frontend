            Ratball's recent rule changes, designed to quicken the game's pace and rejuvenate cheese-stealing, have inadvertently sidelined starting pitchers, raising concerns about the sport's evolving dynamics. Despite these changes, starting pitchers are struggling to maintain their innings dominance.<br><br>Long gone are the celebrated days of titans like Bob Gnawson and Jack Mousis, who dazzled fans with complete games. Their legacies cast a long shadow over today’s reliance on relievers. The drive for quicker games has shifted strategies, marginalizing starters' roles.<br><br>Last season, only a scant few—Whisker Gilbert and Squeaky Lugo among them—managed to exceed 200 innings. The bullpen's rise reflects a strategic pivot, but does it truly serve Ratball's long-term allure?<br><br>Expert voices suggest solutions. Cheese coach Dave Ratberts advocates for rules incentivizing longer outings for starters: "We need to find ways to keep our starters in the game longer, or we'll be left chasing our tails." Players like Nathan Eovaldi echo this sentiment, emphasizing tradition alongside innovation.<br><br>Commissioner Rob Manfurred urges patience, stressing improved training over hasty rule tweaks. "It's not just about rules; it's about nurturing our pitchers to go the distance," he states, underscoring development and endurance.<br><br>A potential solution could be the controversial removal of the designated hitter if starters don’t pitch five innings. However, this risks alienating stars like Shohei Ocheeseni, who embodies the dual-threat excitement fans love. This proposal raises questions about the balance between maintaining tradition and introducing impactful changes.<br><br>Encouraging signs of modest recovery appear with last season’s slight increase in innings and pitches per start. "I miss the days when starters ruled the mound. Let's hope we can bring that back without cheesing off the fans," expresses Cheddar McWhiskers, a Ratopolis native, capturing the nostalgia of many enthusiasts.<br><br>The quest to restore starters' prominence remains fraught with challenges. However, the delicate balance between starter longevity and reliever strategy calls for an evolved approach. The goal remains to sustain the excitement and rich traditions of Ratball while embracing necessary innovations.<br><br>As Ratball evolves, the heart of the game—a celebrated balance of athletic skill and strategic prowess—deserves preservation. Enthusiasts, officials, and players must collaborate to ensure that starting pitchers remain central to this captivating sport, upholding its legacy for generations to come.

            <div class="comment-body">This article is just a bunch of cheese-worshipping nonsense. Starting pitchers are overrated! Welcome to the new era of Ratball where strategy actually matters. Maybe if they weren’t so lazy and could go more than 5 innings, we wouldn’t be in this mess!</div>

            <div class="comment-body">Are you kidding me? CheeseHater53, you clearly don’t know anything about Ratball history! Our greats like Bob Gnawson changed the game. But I agree, a middle ground must be found. Maybe we need to look at how we train our pitchers instead of blaming the rules! Ever thought of that?</div>

            <div class="comment-body">The stats don’t lie! Just because we had a slight uptick last season doesn't mean anything substantial is changing. We NEED to incentivize longer outings like Ratberts suggested instead of just whispering sweet nothings about tradition! Let’s get tough! Less whining, more pitching!</div>
