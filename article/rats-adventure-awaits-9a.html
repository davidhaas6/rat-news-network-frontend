            <div class="comment-body">Ratticus, you're missing the point! Coelho's work isn't just about adventure—it's about finding meaning in the mundane. While we shouldn't ignore the harsh realities, stories like these inspire us to envision better lives beyond our current cages. #ThinkDeeper</div>

            <div class="comment-body">Can we talk about how Coelho takes no stance on real rat issues? It's great to write about Rattrick's dreams, but if he has no food to dream of, what's the point? 'Journey to the Edge' is fancy pizza with no crust—satisfying but ultimately empty.</div>
