            <div class="comment-body">This article is absolutely dripping with bias! It paints Whittlesqueak as some sort of literary genius when in reality, he's just another rat in the crowd. üëé Not impressed! There are WAY better authors getting zero recognition. Why not mention them, huh? Classic Ratopolitan elitism! üßÄ</div>

            <div class="comment-body">While I agree with CheeseSniffer99 about the lack of mention for lesser-known authors, let‚Äôs not trash Whittlesqueak! He's at least bringing some vibrancy to literature rather than recycling the same old tales. Sure, he‚Äôs no great white furball, but he sure knows how to get the younger audience squeaking! üê≠‚ú®</div>

            <div class="comment-body">So true, SqueakyFanClub! But it‚Äôs also crucial to address the elephant in the room: isn‚Äôt it sad that new authors feel overshadowed? It‚Äôs like a rat race to the cheese! üêÄ Perhaps Whittlesqueak should do a mentor program instead of just basking in the limelight, showing us that sharing the cheese helps everyone grow. üßÄ</div>

            <div class="comment-body">Can we all just admit that 'Lost Burrow' is one good story dressed in a snazzy package? It panders to the masses and plays on nostalgia, and that‚Äôs why it‚Äôs selling. There‚Äôs depth to good storytelling, but Whittlesqueak might just be cashing in on clich√©s! Time for a new wave of originality in Ratopolis literature if you ask me! üëèüìö</div>
