            <div class="comment-body">Honestly, it’s great to see new blood in the culinary scene, but let's not pretend that foraging is a cure-all for our culinary stagnation. Urban foraging? More like urban fusing of mediocre scraps. Some of us still cherish roots over your bizarre 'Cheddar Chicory' nonsense! #PatheticHodgepodge</div>
