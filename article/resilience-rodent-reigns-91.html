            <div class="comment-body">Really? McScurry's story is just fluff. Anyone can say 'it's about mental strength' while overlooking the fact that he's genetically gifted. Stop sipping on the delusion juice, people. Size matters! 🐭💨</div>

            <div class="comment-body">Sure, size matters to an extent, CheddarChampion36, but your narrow-mindedness blinds you to the true essence of success. McScurry's grit appeals to the heart of every rat. It's about how we respond to challenges. But you wouldn’t know about that with all those cheese puffs clouding your judgment! 🧀🤦‍♂️</div>

            <div class="comment-body">While I appreciate the motivational aspect, let’s not ignore that not every rat can pull off a perfect training plan like McScurry does. This article pretends like mental fortitude is a one-size-fits-all solution, which it’s not. Look around! The city is filled with talented but underestimated rats. 🐀✨</div>

            <div class="comment-body">It’s a nice sentiment, but let’s face it: McScurry’s success is more about being in the right place at the right time than some inner spark. Motivation is great until you hit the wall—and not all rats bounce back. Let’s celebrate him but also recognize that this narrative excludes a lot of hard-working rodents! 😒</div>
