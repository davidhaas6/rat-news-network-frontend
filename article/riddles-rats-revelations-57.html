            <div class="comment-body">The Riddler represents something deeper than mere theatrics, Cheddar. Riddles are rooted in our culture and wisdom.

            <div class="comment-body">It's all just a farce! Rats venturing into tunnels trying to ‘unlock’ ancient secrets? You’d think they were trying to solve the origins of Swiss cheese! This whole Riddler thing is simply a distractive ploy while the real issues in Ratopolis — like food shortages — fester underneath. Wake up, everyone!</div>

            <div class="comment-body">But isn’t that part of the allure? To question our realities while wrapped in myth? Whether it's deception or discovery, the Riddler challenges us to reflect on our intelligence and urges the community to come together! This could spark conversations we need, regardless of the underlying issues. Why not embrace it?</div>
