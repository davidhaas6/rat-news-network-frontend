            <div class="comment-body">Both of you are missing the point. The balance between innovation and stability is crucial for retaining players. Ratendo should definitely explore new modes, but they need to make sure they don’t alienate the original fan base, especially the casual players. It's a fine line! 🧀🧐</div>
