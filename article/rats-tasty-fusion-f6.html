            <div class="comment-body">Both sides here are blind! The real issue is not whether to innovate or preserve but how to find balance. There's beauty in combinationâ€”why not incorporate rat traditions into new recipes? A nut cluster with a modern twist could respect both worlds. Let's focus on collaboration instead of clashing!</div>

            <div class="comment-body">FlavorsOfRat, that's a cute idea but itâ€™s easier said than done. Youâ€™d think the stall owners would want to preserve their heritage while experimenting, but many just pander to trends! Plus, not everyone can afford those overpriced â€˜innovationsâ€™. #EqualAccess #RealFoodForAll</div>

I vote for â€˜savor the pastâ€™ and a â€˜taste of the futureâ€™ in every bite. More flavors mean more stories rather than just the same cheese wheel!</div>
