If you can’t embrace change, maybe it's time to stop curmudgeoning and let younger generations enjoy their beetroot chips! 🥔#EvolveOrDie</div>

            <div class="comment-body">Both sides here are blind! The real issue is not whether to innovate or preserve but how to find balance. There's beauty in combination—why not incorporate rat traditions into new recipes? A nut cluster with a modern twist could respect both worlds. Let's focus on collaboration instead of clashing!</div>

            <div class="comment-body">FlavorsOfRat, that's a cute idea but it’s easier said than done. You’d think the stall owners would want to preserve their heritage while experimenting, but many just pander to trends!

Just look at how those new snacks overshadow the iconic rat cheesesteak. If we aren’t careful, Ratopolis will become just another bland spot for tourists. Real rats support real heritage.</div>

I vote for ‘savor the past’ and a ‘taste of the future’ in every bite. More flavors mean more stories rather than just the same cheese wheel!</div>
