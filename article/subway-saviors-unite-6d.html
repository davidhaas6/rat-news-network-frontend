            <div class="comment-body">This article is just a lovey-dovey fluff piece for the Tunnel Guardians. Sure, they do some work, but let's not pretend they're the only rats that keep this city running! What about the cheese delivery crew who face real danger every day? Are we really going to bow down to these glorified maintenance workers? It's time we recognize all the rats in Ratopolis, not just the ones who live in the shadows!</div>

            <div class="comment-body">Wow, CheeseLover99, talk about missing the point. The Tunnel Guardians ARE essential! Without them, we'd be up a creek without a squeak! It's not just about the maintenance; it's about the emotional toll and the bravery it takes to navigate those dark tunnels daily. Can't you show some respect for the hard-working rats who keep our subways safe? Maybe you should do some research before throwing shade! Their mental fortitude is just as important as any rat’s job, but I get it—jealousy is a common trait.</div>
