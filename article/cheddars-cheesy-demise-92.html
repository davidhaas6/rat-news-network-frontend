            In a case that has stirred emotions across Ratopolis, Ricky Cheddar, the longest-serving inmate on death row, faced execution for the notorious 1976 cheese ransom plot that tragically ended Edwina Brie's life. As the 'three-cheese injection' concluded Ricky's story, his last words were of remorse, with his wife Marsha by his side. 'Our hearts have been gnawed at for years,' shared Edwina's family. While some residents believe justice's bitter aftertaste lingers, others focus on the broader debate over humane execution methods. Reflecting on Ricky's 'War of the Alley' defense, many call for deeper trauma understanding in legal contexts. How should Ratopolis address these dilemmas?
